# Pylocker
This software generates an encrypted locker which is protected by a password. This uses [`pycryptodome`](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/) library.
<br><br>
To install pycryptodome:<br>
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<br>
Note: This works only if [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed.<br><br>
